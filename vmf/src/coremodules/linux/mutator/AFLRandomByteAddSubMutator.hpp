/**
 * @brief This mutator adds and subtracts bounded random values to a random byte in the buffer
 * 
 * Note that ARITH_MAX is set to 35, so the random value is signicantly
 * bounded.
 * 
 * This module is draws heavily upon the libAFL mutator.c
 * 
 * Uses the specified AFL-style mutation algorithm to mutate the provided
 * input.  createTestCase is the main mutation method.
 * 
 * See https://github.com/AFLplusplus/LibAFL-legacy/blob/dev/src/mutator.c
 * 
 * The following includes code copied from the LibAFL_Legacy repository.
